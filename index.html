						<h2 class="major">"Stick" by <a href="#mellits">Marc Mellits</a></h2>
						<p>Comissioned for the 2010 Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Modern
							Snare Drum Competition. The piece uses 18 seperate extended techniques
							for the performer, requiring them to play all over the drum.
							The effect is a composition that seeks to transform the typical
							monopitched snare drum into a melodic instrument.</p>

						<h2 class="major">"Thunder Song" By Jerod Tate</h2>
						<p>The Chickasaw word for thunder and lightning is Heloha and, in history,
							Chickasaw people believed thunderstorms were the beloved, or holy people
							at war above the clouds. In an attempt to show their bravery and fearlessness
							of death, warriors would shot their guns into the air during thunder storms.
							This work is an homage to those old ways. Thunder Song was
							comissioned by and dedicated to Alex Orfaly.</p>

						<h2 class="major">"Rebonds A" By <a href="#xenakis">Iannis Xenakis</a></h2>
						<p>Described by Jacques Lonchamps as "An immense abstract ritual,
							a suite of movements and of hammerings without any folklorist 'contamination',
							pure music full of marvellously efforescent rhythms, going beyond drama
							and tempest. A new masterpiece." The work is scored for one percussionist playing
							only mempranophones (drums with skins): two bass drums, 2 tom-toms, and two bongos."</p>

						<h2 class="major">"Toccata" By Anna Ignatowicz</h2>
						<p>"Toccata" for Marimba was composed by Anna Ignatowicz in 2001
							and is dedicated to her father. It received its debut performance
							by her husband in Warsaw in 2001. "This is my farewell to my
							father and a tribute to his memory. When I was writing this
							work I had to 'go through my daddy's life,' coming back to
							the times before my birth. A part of myself also changed
							into ashes at theis moment. If there is any trace of this
							process in the score, it may only be the utlra-subjective
							narration, which individual performers may, however,
							understand in different ways. Toccata is not a programmatic
							work and my personal comments do not relate to the details
							of interpretation."</p>
